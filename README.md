Back in the good old days of the Renaissance, [apprenticeships](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Apprenticeship) were quite common and acted as legal contracts between the apprentice and master. This was a way for apprentices to start learning the necessary skills in their field and eventually become masters themselves.

Even though the formal university route became more popular over time, there has been a noteworthy trend in the software industry where the idea of an intensive period of training with masters (e.g. [coding bootcamps](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Coding_bootcamp)) has started to become a popular option once again.

So, without further ado, here's a list of developer & design apprenticeship opportunities! 🔧

> Note that most of these companies don't **always** have applications to their apprenticeship programs open - it's usually seasonal.
